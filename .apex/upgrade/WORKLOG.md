## WP-001 — Capture tree fingerprint · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: +.apex/upgrade/BASELINE.md
Decision: none needed — every field of `02 §2` was observable directly.
Verify: `git rev-parse HEAD`, `node -v`, `npm -v`, `git status --porcelain`, `sha256sum START-HERE.md`
  — all literal outputs pasted into BASELINE.md §1–§2.
Evidence: EVD-001 (fingerprint fields recorded alongside the suite output).
Surprises: none. Tree matches `42 §1` exactly (same facts, same commit lineage).
Next: WP-002

## WP-002 — Execute the untouched baseline suite · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: ~.apex/upgrade/BASELINE.md
Decision: ran `npm run verify` end-to-end once (all five steps) rather than only `npm test`,
  because the catalogue's default verify command is the full pipeline and BASE-T01 demands
  execution, not inference.
Verify: `npm run verify` -> 671 pass, 0 fail, 0 cancelled, exit 0, 25.7s.
Evidence: EVD-001.
Surprises: none. The earlier standalone `npm test` run reproduced identical counts.
Next: WP-003

## WP-003 — Reconcile the runtime support policy · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: ~.apex/upgrade/BASELINE.md (§5)
Decision: the packaged floor and the contributor floor are identical (`>=22.6.0`) because the
  test toolchain itself requires native type stripping — no split floors to publish. The
  22.6.x floor is NOT_RUN locally (only Node v24.16.0 installed); it is covered by the
  existing CI matrix (node 22 + 24 on windows/ubuntu/macos, packed-tarball install), which
  already matches `43 §6`. Defer floor-specific evidence to CI (WP-081), per `02 §6`.
Verify: matrix comparison against `.github/workflows/verify.yml` (read, confirmed) — recorded
  in BASELINE.md §5. No local 22.x run: recorded `NOT_RUN` with the reason.
Surprises: none. The plan's `43 §6` and the tree's existing CI already agree.
Next: WP-004

## WP-004 — Classify pre-existing failures · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: ~.apex/upgrade/BASELINE.md (§6), +.apex/REQUIREMENTS.md (seeded)
Decision: baseline suite had ZERO failures, so there is nothing to classify as
  product-defect / environment-drift / harness-incompatibility. The upgrade's blocking
  requirements were seeded into a NEW project Ledger at the repository root `.apex/`
  (the runtime package's `runtime/.apex/` is the runtime's own dogfooding ledger and was
  left untouched — using it would have mixed two projects' truth). Seeding used the product's
  own `Ledger` engine so row shape, id rules and the totals line come from the real code.
Surprises: the repository had no root `.apex/` before this packet; one was created by init.
  The pre-existing untracked file `apex-army-v3.md` at the root was left untouched (not
  project source, not modified by the upgrade).
Next: WP-005

## WP-005 — Open the upgrade ledger · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: +.apex/upgrade/STATE.json, +.apex/upgrade/WORKLOG.md
Decision: STATE.json additionally carries `packetOrder` and a full `dependencies` map
  (catalogue + `54 §21` insertions) so a successor agent can select the next packet
  mechanically without re-reading 49/54 to reconstruct the graph — `52`'s schema is extended
  additively, all its fields kept. 92 packets enumerated (77 primary + 15 second-pass),
  `WPC-T05` satisfied. Every dependency edge was validated (no unknown ids, no cycles,
  all packets reachable from the phase structure).
Verify: `node -e \"JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.apex/upgrade/STATE.json','utf8'))\"`
  -> valid JSON (exit 0). See EVD-002.
Evidence: EVD-002.
Surprises: `49` lists 75 primary packet ids in phase sections but also names WP-057 in the
  Phase 5 gate and second-pass packets reference each other; the enumeration was built from
  the phase tables plus the dependency summary plus `54 §21`, then cross-checked: every id in
  49 appears, plus the 15 from 54.
Next: WP-006

## WP-006 — Freeze the no-regression contract · DONE · 2026-09-10

Files: +.apex/upgrade/NO-REGRESSION.md
Decision: each `42 §11` behaviour is listed with its proving test file and the named test
  ids that appeared in the WP-002 run output. The run output shows suite-level counts; the
  per-test ids were taken from the test sources' describe/test names, all of which executed
  in the 671-test green run.
Verify: the named tests are part of the suite that produced the WP-002 result (EVD-001,
  exit 0). See NO-REGRESSION.md for the table.
Evidence: EVD-001.
Surprises: none.
Next: Phase 0 exit gate recorded — phase0: PASSED in STATE.json. Begin Phase 1 (WP-010).
